# Summary
What's going on with re-defining the `type` for OpenXR structures?

# Rationale
If you take a look at any struct defined in the OpenXR spec, you will see that the first property in the struct always defines a `XrStructureType`. Here's some examples:

``` c++
typedef struct XrExtensionProperties {
    XrStructureType    type;
    void*              next;
    char               extensionName[XR_MAX_EXTENSION_NAME_SIZE];
    uint32_t           extensionVersion;
} XrExtensionProperties;

typedef struct XrApiLayerProperties {
    XrStructureType       type;
    void* XR_MAY_ALIAS    next;
    char                  layerName[XR_MAX_API_LAYER_NAME_SIZE];
    XrVersion             specVersion;
    uint32_t              layerVersion;
    char                  description[XR_MAX_API_LAYER_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
} XrApiLayerProperties;

typedef struct XrInstanceCreateInfo {
    XrStructureType             type;
    const void* XR_MAY_ALIAS    next;
    XrInstanceCreateFlags       createFlags;
    XrApplicationInfo           applicationInfo;
    uint32_t                    enabledApiLayerCount;
    const char* const*          enabledApiLayerNames;
    uint32_t                    enabledExtensionCount;
    const char* const*          enabledExtensionNames;
} XrInstanceCreateInfo;
```

But why do we need that `type` parameter, and why do we have to explicity set it to an enumeration?

Take a look at the next member of that each of those structs. It's a `void* next` (or `void* XR_MAY_ALIAS`). This is used to 'chain' additional data for extension. So what does that actually mean?

Something that we can do if we want to write an OpenXR Extension, if override any OpenXR function with our own implementation. And because of that, we may want to make additional information available to that extension. We do that through the use of the `next` and `type` parameter.

You can actually see this in action when we look at creating an OpenXR session, and we bind it with a given graphics subsystem.
